# GoldCostEstimator
A chrome extension that looks at loaded reddit posts and determines an estimate of how much was spent to gild it.

### About

With the announcement of Reddit Coins and the new silver/platinum you can give out on Reddit, I was curious how much each post was "paid". I used the base value of coins from reddit.com/coins and calculated based on that (ignoring promotions, bulk discounts, etc.). Its by no means an actual cost, but a moderate estimate. I mostly used this as an excuse to learn a bit of JS and learn how to make a Chrome Extension.
